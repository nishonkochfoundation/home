		Spirit of Ramadan
		<br>
		<p>
			The act of fasting calls for Muslims to practice self-discipline and sacrifice, as well as reflect upon and show compassion for the poor and less fortunate. 
But there are middle class family and people living below poverty line who are struggling to meet their month ends with the soaring price of basic necessities during this month and yet anyhow break their fast in miserable condition . <br>
So nishonkoch foundation stands beside these group of people with their event ‘ spirit of Ramadan’ in which ration and basic commodity are provided .
