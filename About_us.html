		Why was it created?
	</div></font></h1>
	<p>
		<font color="white">
			So one day we decided to spend a day with the dwelling street kids of kamalapur and the day was 31st of December, whereas many of us had plans to celebrate the night and welcome the year with their own resolutions. So we decided to start doing something for society as our new year's resolution and hence we moved on with several different projects till date.

	What are the annual activities?
</div></font></h1>	
	<p>
		<font color="white">
			We start our year (January) with Education For All distributing educational materials like stationeries and other motivational gifts for underprivileged students in the presence of their parents.
<br>
<br>
We have this project TrashTag Challenge (March) where we have a day long drive to clean up the streets and spread the message among the people to keep the city clean.
<br>
<br>
Our flagship event Spirit of Ramadan (according to the Ramadan month in normal calender) upholds every year where we ensure a food package which sustains at least till EID for the people who cannot celebrate like us or couldn't ask for help, to give them the same vibe of Ramadan and EID.
<br>
<br>
We have this different sort of event Street Food Hygiene (August-September)
<br>
<br>
where we encourage the street food vendors to serve the street food with complete hygiene.
<br>
<br>
Lastly we celebrate our founding Anniversary with the street kids and spend a whole day with them running, jumping and all.
